                    when you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.

                    We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving
                    force behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people
                    we make it for.

                    between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles
                    and Tokyo.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us
                    use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural
                    and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are
                    self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects
                    us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge
                    to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
                    culture.

                    Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our
                    people what they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned
                    that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are
                    richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set
                    of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion
                    and debate are valued and openly encouraged.
