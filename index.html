                <p>
                    Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us
                    use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural
                    and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are
                    self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects
                    us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge
                    to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
                    culture.

                    that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are
                    richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set
                    of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion
                    and debate are valued and openly encouraged.
